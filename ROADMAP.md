The roadmap of this is pretty simple and we will be adding more features as we go along. Before proceeding with a roadmap, we will need to make sure that we have a good understanding of the project.

## Overview

We would be creating a mobile version of [Imgflip](https://imgflip.com/). Imgflip is a simple and fast website for creating and sharing images. They specialize in memes and GIFs. Imgflip LLC is a bootstrapped company; they have received no venture funding. They are advised by [ScOp VC](https://www.scopvc.com/).

Since we haven't talked to Imflip that we will be creating a mobile version of their app, thus its unofficial. But the good part is it's open source and will be maintained in the long run if we manage to successfully reach our first MVP. We would be using their [public API](https://imgflip.com/api) to fetch and create memes and GIFs from the mobile. If policies permits and they allow to use their logo and name, we would be able to use their logo and name in our app and maybe upload in the respective app stores too.

## Planning

**Let's divide the initial MVP into 3 stages**

1. We will design the app and user interface with fake data first.
2. After we have the design, we will start implementing the api and the functionalities of each and every screen.
3. Once everything is done, we will monitor for bugs and performance issues and make sure that everything is working as expected.
